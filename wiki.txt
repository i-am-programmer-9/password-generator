Editing pages
Since spamming and vandalism on this wiki had reached a level that required constant intervention, unfamiliar users are no longer allowed to edit pages. However all you need to do is introduce yourself to the wiki admin group to become an editor.

If you want to edit a page and have just signed up, or find that you can no longer edit a page that you could edit before, please write to the pydotorg-www mailing list describing what you would like to edit, and we'll add you to the EditorsGroup. Please include your account name (wiki name) in this message.

Sorry for any inconvenience, but we want to keep this wiki a useful tool for the community, while at the same time preventing the wiki admins from burning out cleaning up junk.
